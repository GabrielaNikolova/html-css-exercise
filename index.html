        <h1>History of Italy</h1>
        <h2>Early History</h2>
        <p>
          Italy was the birthplace and centre of the ancient Roman civilisation.
          Rome was founded as a kingdom in 753 BC and became a republic in 509
          BC. The Roman Republic then unified Italy forming a confederation of
          the Italic peoples and rose to dominate Western Europe, Northern
          Africa, and the Near East. After the assassination of Julius Caesar,
          the Roman Empire dominated Western Europe and the Mediterranean for
          centuries, contributing to the development of Western culture,
          philosophy, science and art. With the fall of Rome in AD 476, Italy
          was fragmented into numerous city-states and regional polities, a
          situation that would remain until the complete unification of the
          country in 1871. The maritime republics, in particular Venice and
          Genoa, rose to prosperity. Central Italy remained under the Papal
          States, while Southern Italy remained largely feudal due to a
          succession of Byzantine, Arab, Norman, Spanish, and Bourbon crowns.
          The Italian Renaissance spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a
          renewed interest in humanism, science, exploration, and art with the
          start of the modern era.
        </p>
        <h2>Modern day Italy</h2>
        <p>
          Italy has the eighth-largest nominal GDP in the world, the
          second-largest manufacturing industry in Europe (7th-largest in the
          world). The country has a significant role in regional and global
          economic, military, cultural, and diplomatic affairs. Italy is a
          founding and leading member of the European Union, and it is in
          numerous international institutions including NATO, the G7, the
          Mediterranean Union, the Latin Union, and many more. The source of
          many inventions and discoveries, the country is considered a cultural
          superpower and has long been a global centre of art, music,
          literature, cuisine, science and technology and fashion. It has the
          world's largest number of World Heritage Sites (58), and is the
          world's fifth-most visited country.

            Although there are other Roman amphitheaters in Italy, Rome's
            Colosseum is the world's largest and most visited Roman arena.
            Ancient Rome's huge amphitheater, built by Emperor Vespasian in AD
            80, held as many as 55,000 spectators. Deadly gladiatorial and wild
            animal fights were often held in the Colosseum but it was used for
            other events as well.

            The Roman city of Pompeii was buried by an eruption of Mount
            Vesuvius volcano in 79 AD and now its ruins give a good look at what
            an ancient Roman city was like. The site includes villas, baths,
            shops, an arena, temples, and the Forum. There's a lot to see so
            plan to spend several hours. ​Select Italy offers a half-day guided
            tour, ​Totally Ruined: The Excavations at Pompeii.
